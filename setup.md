## Picking a Platform
<!-- testing out the green section -->
<div class="special-green-section" markdown="1">
In order to submit to the [official leaderboards](https://www.speedrun.com/super_mario_eclipse), you need to play on one of the supported platforms:

Dolphin Emulator  
Emulator is recommended since it can handle 60 FPS and is also the faster version of the game  
due to quicker fade outs and shine selects. There are also a handful of other minor differences  
between 60 and 30 FPS.   


Nintendo Wii (Homebrew)
This option is also avaliable however it is the less competitive category due to the Wii's limitations for  
running Eclipse. Depending on the wii version you use there is performance issues with 60 FPS or choppy/buggy music
audio making it less enjoyable. Regardless the 30FPS category is still available for people who do enjoy playing on
console or do not want to get involved with setting up Emulator.  


Here are two guides [Homebrew guide1](https://wii.hacks.guide/) and [Homebrew guide2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GNHU6p33Fk0KB_iGcuga_PmUPf6dS5dPZIskDbtdU0M/edit?tab=t.0) 
that you can read to set up a homebrewed Wii  
Here is a video guide to setup [Homebrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqIQXIPZhzM)
This is a list of [**recommended hardware**](https://eclipsewiki.github.io/setup/hardware) to stream and record footage for Wii.

## Leaderboard Verification
In order to have your run verified on our official leaderboards, there are rules which are specified [here](https://www.speedrun.com/super_mario_eclipse?h=any-60-fps&rules=game&x=mkemp582-wlegjq4n.1py0n281)


**Practice Codes Guide**  
CAUTION: since this is Super Mario Eclipse some of these practice codes will not work.  
However there are a handful of them that are still useful mainly fast reset or the input display.  
Still worth playing around with but do not expect all available practice codes from here to work properly  
due to the practice codes being made for Mario Sunshine instead of Mario Eclipse.  
[Homebrew](https://wii.hacks.guide/) your wii and install [Nintendont](https://zint.ch/NintendontPackager/).  
Check out our [in-depth guide](https://gct.zint.ch/guide.html) on installing practice codes.  

‼️ MAKE SURE NATIVE CONTROLS ARE ON IN NINTENDONT SETTINGS ‼️
